## `r emo::ji("target")` Objectives


## `r emo::ji("wrench")` Preparation  

Install the `janitor` R package.

```{r pkgs, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("janitor", "ggridges", "ggforce"))
```

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.align = "center", 
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE
)
```


Note that most questions do not have a definitive "correct" answer so be creative!

    
## üíéÔ∏è Exercise 6A

**Diamonds**


The dataset `diamonds` in the `ggplot2` package includes attributes and price on `r scales::comma(nrow(diamonds))` diamonds. Some of the attributes, such as carat, cut, color and clarity, are known to influence the price. Figures \@ref(fig:diamonds-color) and \@ref(fig:diamonds-clarity) explain the order of classifications for color and clarity of diamonds. Use this data to answer the following questions.

```{r q6Adata}
data("diamonds", package = "ggplot2")
dplyr::glimpse(diamonds)
```

```{r diamonds-color, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Diamond color image sourced from https://beyond4cs.com"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://beyond4cs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/diamond-color-chart-with-example-diamonds-of-each-alphabet.jpg")
```

```{r diamonds-clarity, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Diamond clarity image sourced from https://www.onlinediamondbuyingadvice.com"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.onlinediamondbuyingadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/diamond-clarity-scale-whiteflash-768x219.png")
```

```{r q6Ac, fig.height=10, fig.cap="Density plots for carats by cut, clarity and color."}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, clarity)) + 
  ggridges::geom_density_ridges(scale = 4) +
  facet_grid(color ~ cut)
```


(a) [Is there anything unusual about the distribution of diamond weights (i.e. carats)? Which plot do you think shows it best? How might you explain the pattern you find?]{.question}
(b) [What about the distribution of the prices? Can you find any unexpected feature? Which graphics best shows this unexpected feature?]{.question}
(c) Suppose that this data are a representative sample of diamonds around the world. 
    i. The exploratory plot in Figure \@ref(fig:q6Ac) shows that there are hardly any diamonds with high carats that have high level of clarity.  [Produce a plot to support/contradict this claim.]{.question}
    ii. A diamonds whole seller wants to convince the jewellery store owner that $5,000 for a 2 carat diamond is a bargain price. [Show a graphic that supports this story.]{.question}



## üö¢ Exercise 6B

**Titanic**

*Titanic* was a British ship that can carry over 2,000 people. It is most well known for meeting its end at the 15th April 1912 when it hit an iceberg and sank. 


```{r q6Bdata}
dfB <- as.data.frame(Titanic)
glimpse(dfB)
```

(a) "Women and children first" was a code of conduct where the lives of women and children are to be saved first in life-threatening situations. [Produce a graphic that best supports whether this code of conduct was applied when Titanic was sinking.]{.question}
(b) There are far more men than women on board Titanic. This is because majority of crew members are male. [Produce a graphic to show this.]{.question}

## üîß Exercise 6C

**Global Crop Yields**

The data below comes from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/crop-yields) and sourced from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/readme.md). This data contains agricultural yields across crop types and by country from 1960 onwards. 

```{r q6Cdata}
key_crop_yields <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/key_crop_yields.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
dplyr::glimpse(key_crop_yields)
```

The code below is one way to extract the map data and draws the map.

```{r q6Cmap}
library(ggplot2)
map_df <- map_data("world")
dplyr::glimpse(map_df)

ggplot(map_df, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white") +   
  coord_equal() + 
  theme_void()
```


(a) [Produce a choropleth map of the wheat yield by country in 1998 and then in 2018.]{.question}
(b) [Produce a single graphic that highlights one major change in wheat yield in 2018 compared to 1998.]{.question}
(c) You're on the quest to find the 2018 World Crop Capital for each crop type!  [Produce graphic(s) to show which countries have the greatest crop yields per hectare. Publish this to your RPub account and submit your RPub url to Moodle.]{.question} 
(d) Global crop production has been increasing over time. [Produce a graphic that shows this effectively.]{.question}
