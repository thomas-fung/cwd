## `r emo::ji("target")` Objectives

- embed HTML widgets in R Markdown documents using `htmlwidgets`, inspect the resulting HTML file and make some CSS changes
- implement a simple cross-widget interactions using `crosstalk` and think of how the widgets are interacting
- understand why certain questions are hard to answer 
- create a minimum reproducible example


## `r emo::ji("wrench")` Preparation  

   
1. Download <a href="tutorial-02-suppA.Rmd" download>`tutorial-02-suppA.Rmd`</a> amd <a href="tutorial-02-suppB.Rmd" download>`tutorial-02-suppB.Rmd`</a> by clicking on the names.

1. Install R-packages
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("htmlwidgets", "crosstalk", "reprex", "plotly", "timevis", "palmerpenguins"))
```
    
## üåêÔ∏è Exercise 2A

**JavaScript in R Markdown documents with `htmlwidgets`**

There are many JavaScript libraries for interactive data visualisation. The problem is that for a typical statistician/analyst/data scientist is not trained to work with JavaScript code. The `htmlwidgets` R-package provides a framework that makes it easier for developers to create a widget that allow other R users to easily use JavaScript libraries. There are now over 100 registered widgets found at http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/.

1. Open `tutorial-02-suppA.Rmd` and Knit. You should find that there is [a similar timeline visualisation as you in your lecture](https://cwd.numbat.space/lectures/lecture-02.html#6) except the boxes have a blue background. 
2. [Change the background color of these boxes to white]{.question} and publish this to your [RPubs account](https://rpubs.com/) (recall Case Study 8 from Lecture 1). **Submit your RPub URL to Moodle** under Engagement Opportunities > Tutorial 2A. Note that your HTML document should not have any external file dependencies (i.e. embed your CSS within the document) as RPubs does not upload external files.


## üêß Exercise 2B

**Cross-widget interaction with `crosstalk`** 

This exercise is a warmup to Week 5 where we will look more examples of `crosstalk` and `plotly` as well as `shiny`. The aim here is to get you to play and inspect the resulting HTML file. We'll introduce you to `shiny` in Week 5 and this will help you think about how it might be different to `shiny`.

Open `tutorial-02-suppB.Rmd` and Knit.

## üîß Exercise 2C

**Reproducible example**

Study each of the examples from stackoveflow and write the good points of their communication and where applicable, how you would improve communicating the author's problem.
