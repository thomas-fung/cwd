# üéØ ETC5523 Learning Objectives

<br>
.info-box.wider-list.width70[
1. Effectively communicate data analysis, using a blog, reports and presentation.
2. Learn how to build a web app to provide an interactive data analysis.
3. Learn to construct a data story.

# üó£ Communicating 

<br>

<blockquote>
To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.
<br><br>

<footer>‚ÄîAnthony Robbins</footer>
</blockquote>

--

<br>

Your engagement with your peers will be critical to form your understanding and become a better communicator.

---

# üìà Communicating *with Data*

<br>

<blockquote>
The two words 'information' and 'communication' are often used interchangeably, but they signify quite different things. Information is giving out; communication is getting through.  
<br><br>

<footer>‚ÄîSydney J. Harris</footer>
</blockquote>

--

<br>

In this course, you will construct narratives from your number-crunching to tell a compelling data story.

# ü§ù Key Ingredient of a Successful Communication 

<span style="font-size:100pt!important; font-weight:900;">TRUST </span>

Trust in the **data collection process**

--

Trust in the **data entry**

--

Trust in the **data processing**

--

Trust in the **number crunching**

--

Trust in **your skills**

--

Trust **assumptions are reasonable**


--

Trust in the **software**

--

Trust in **interpretations**


$\vdots$


---

# üëç Building Trust 


# Minimise errors 

* We are all **prone to errors** no matter how skilled we are.
* Adopting **reproducible practices** (e.g. git + R Markdown) helps to **minimise this error**. .font_small[(note: it does not completely eradicate it)]

--

# Be transparent

* Share code and data (where you can). This not only builds trust in the results, this gives opportunities for others to correct any errors. .font_small[See also about [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science), [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and [open-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data).]
* Give credit and acknowledgement where due.

--

# Interrogate your data, tools and sources

* Use trusted software (preferably with proper testing). 
* Sanity check your data, tools and sources.

# üíØ Assessment .font_small[Part 1/3]

# Engagement (total 10%)

* Lecture and tutorial participation will contribute to this.
* If you have some clashes for lecture or tutorial, there are other opportunities to show your engagement, including:
  * posting in the Moodle discussion forum, 
  * github commits (more on this later in the course), 
  * peer reviewing (more on this later in the course), and 
  * online submissions (see Tutorial Q1C for example). 
* There should be **at least 3 measurable and meaningful engagement activities each week** (contributing to 1% of your final mark capped to 10% over the whole semester; in other words, you can miss 2 weeks, .font_small[or 4 weeks counting mid-semester break although harder to gain engagement marks over that period], without impacting your mark). 

---

# üíØ Assessment .font_small[Part 2/3]

# Take Home Assessment (15%)

* Will be made available at Thu 20 Aug 7PM. 
* You will have 24 hours (i.e. **due Fri 21 Aug 7PM**) to complete the assessment. 
* You will be given an document that you have to reproduce using R Markdown.

# Blog Entries (20%)

* You will have 4 blog entries featuring a data story  **due Fri 4 Sep 2020**, **Fri 18 Sep 2020**, **Fri 16 Oct 2020** and  **Fri 30 Oct 2020**.
* You will write these blogs using R Markdown.

---

# üíØ Assessment .font_small[Part 3/3]



# Assignment 1: Making a Shiny web app (20%)

* You will make an interactive web application to communicate a data story using `shiny`
* The app will be **due Fri 9 Oct**

# Assignment 2: Making an R-package (25%)

* You will make an R-package that has clear documentation, vignettes, consistent coding style, and robust functions (as demonstrated by testing).
* The R-package will be **due Fri 23 Oct**

# Group Presentation (10%)

* Group of 3-4 to present 5 minutes at **Tue 3 Nov 4PM**

---

# üî∂ Expectations .font_small[Part 1/3]

* Lectures are recorded but you are expected to have either attended the lecture, or watched the recordings fully, prior to the tutorial for the week.
* Tutorials may not be recorded, and attendance is expected.
* Questions related to the course should be raised at moodle discussion forum.
* For personal or private administrative issues, the email contact is: ETC5523.Clayton-x@monash.edu
* If you register after the start of the semester or if you miss a lecture/tutorial, it is your responsibility to catch up with missed material, learn about due dates for material to be turned in, and getting assigned to a group for team work, as necessary.
* All times are given in AEST (Melbourne time).

---

# üî∂ Expectations .font_small[Part 2/3]

* The computer software [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) will be used for the unit. 
* You will need to install latest versions of all necessary software (below is not an exhaustive list for this course). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "shiny", "broom", 
  "skimr", "blogdown", "distill", "knitr", "kableExtra", "feasts",
  "devtools", "usethis", "testthat", "roxygen2", "knitr", "fable",

`r engage()`

1. Start with the test assignment by clicking on the link given in [Moodle](https://lms.monash.edu/course/view.php?id=81235) **before Fri 7 Aug 11PM** and make sure you identify yourself by connecting your name to the roster.
2. Once you have accepted it .font_small[(note: some browsers do not work well with GitHub Classroom so use Chrome or Firefox)], you can find your repo here:
<center>
<a href="https://github.com/etc5523-2020">https://github.com/etc5523-2020</a>
</center>
3. If you don't recall how to connect this repo locally, check [this guide](https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-students).
4. Make some small changes to your repo and make sure these changed are pushed to GitHub.

The aim for you should be to independently search and find your solution.

# Case study .circle[1] `knitr::opts_chunk$set` 

.grid[.item.border-right[
* Repeating chunk options can be painful in your workflow. 
* If you are say writing `echo = FALSE` for every single chunk, you might as well set the default chunk option to `echo = FALSE`. 
* Remember **don't repeat yourself** (DRY) every time.
* In order to change the default chunk options you can use 

```{r, eval = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
]
.item[

{{content}}
]
]

--

* You can get the current default by using the following command:

```{r}
str(knitr::opts_chunk$get())
```

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Chunk Options


* You can always overwrite the default for each chunk.

````md
`r ''````{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
````

* For chunk options, check out https://yihui.name/knitr/options/.

# <i class="fas fa-broom"></i> Organising your Rmd file

* <i class="fas fa-cog monash-ruby2"></i> It is good practice to .monash-ruby2[set default chunk options at the beginning of your Rmd file] just as it is good practice to .monash-ruby2[load all packages needed at the beginning]. 
* <i class="fas fa-eye monash-ruby2"></i> This makes it easier to quickly see what the expected behaviour of the chunks for anyone (including yourself) looking at the file.

# üñºÔ∏è Figures in R 

In R, we can classify pictures into two types:
  1. Figures constructed using R with result communicated to a specific [graphical device](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/grDevices/html/Devices.html).
  2. Images already existing as a filie elsewhere with extensions such as `bmp`, `eps`, `gif`, `jpeg`, `pdf`, `png`, `psd`, `svg`, `tex`, `tiff`, or `wmf`.
